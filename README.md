ðŸ§  Impact of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health and Daily Routines
This research study investigates the psychological and behavioral impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young individuals. Using a survey-based approach, the study explores how the pandemic influenced three core areas: social isolation, anxiety and depression, and daily routine disruptions.
Data were collected through self-reported surveys and analyzed using SPSS, with paired samples t-tests employed to test the hypotheses. The findings reveal a significant increase in perceived social isolation, mental health challenges, and routine disruptions among youth post-pandemic.
The study offers evidence-based recommendations to improve access to psychological support, promote social connectedness, and encourage routine management, ultimately guiding policy interventions for youth mental well-being in the post-pandemic world.
